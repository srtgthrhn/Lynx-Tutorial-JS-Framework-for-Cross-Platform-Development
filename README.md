### About the App

Lynx Game Search, built with Lynx by ByteDance, is a comprehensive app designed to provide users with detailed information about various video games, including game covers, ratings, release dates, screenshots, genres, platforms, developers, and similar games. It also features a list of upcoming and ongoing gaming events, categorized game lists, and a robust search functionality.
